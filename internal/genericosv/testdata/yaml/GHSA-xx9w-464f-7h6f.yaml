summary: Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating a robot account
description: |-
    ### Impact Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating a robot
    account that belongs to a project that the authenticated user doesn’t have
    access to. API call:

    PUT /robots/{robot_id}

    By sending a request that attempts to update a robot account, and specifying a
    robot account id and robot account name that belongs to a different project that
    the user doesn’t have access to, it was possible to revoke the robot account
    permissions.

    ### Patches This and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please
    upgrade as soon as possible.

    ### Workarounds There are no workarounds available.

    ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this
    advisory:
    * Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)
