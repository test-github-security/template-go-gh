summary: Login screen allows message spoofing if SSO is enabled
description: |-
    ### Impact

    A vulnerability was found in Argo CD that allows an attacker to spoof error
    messages on the login screen when SSO is enabled.

    In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to trick the
    victim to visit a specially crafted URL which contains the message to be
    displayed.

    As far as the research of the Argo CD team concluded, it is not possible to
    specify any active content (e.g. Javascript) or other HTML fragments (e.g.
    clickable links) in the spoofed message.

    ### Patched versions

    A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD
    versions:
