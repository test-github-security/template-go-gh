summary: Debug mode leaks confidential data in Cilium
description: |-
    ### Impact

    When run in debug mode, Cilium may log sensitive information.

    In particular, Cilium running in debug mode will log the values of headers if
    they match HTTP network policy rules. This issue affects Cilium versions:

    - 1.7.* to 1.10.* inclusive
    - 1.11.* before 1.11.16
    - 1.12.* before 1.12.9
    - 1.13.* before 1.13.2

    In addition, Cilium 1.12.* before 1.12.9 and 1.13.* before 1.13.2., when running
    in debug mode, might log secrets used by the Cilium agent. This includes TLS
    private keys for Ingress and GatewayAPI resources, depending on the
    configuration of the affected cluster. Output of the confidential data would
    occur at Cilium agent restart, when the secrets are modified, and on creation of
    Ingress or GatewayAPI resources.

    ### Patches

    This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium releases 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2.

    ### Workarounds Disable debug mode.

    ### Acknowledgements The Cilium community has worked together with members of
    Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @meyskens for
    investigating and fixing the issue.
