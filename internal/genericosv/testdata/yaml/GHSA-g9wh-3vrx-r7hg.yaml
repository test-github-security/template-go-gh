summary: OctoRPKI crashes when processing GZIP bomb returned via malicious repository
description: |-
    OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the
    case of a GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a
    repository that makes OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).
