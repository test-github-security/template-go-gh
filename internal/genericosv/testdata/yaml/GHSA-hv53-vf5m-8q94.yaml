summary: personnummer/go vulnerable to Improper Input Validation
description: |-
    This vulnerability was reported to the personnummer team in June 2020. The slow
    response was due to locked ownership of some of the affected packages, which
    caused delays to update packages prior to disclosure.

    The vulnerability is determined to be low severity.

    ### Impact

    This vulnerability impacts users who rely on the for last digits of personnummer
    to be a _real_ personnummer.

    ### Patches

    The issue have been patched in all repositories. The following versions should
    be updated to as soon as possible:

    Swift 1.0.1

    If you are using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.

    ### Workarounds

    The issue arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits
    in the last four digits of the personnummer to be 000, which is invalid. To
    mitigate this without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to
    make sure it's not 000x.
