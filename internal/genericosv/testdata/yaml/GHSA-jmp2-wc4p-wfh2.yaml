summary: |-
    Mutagen list and monitor operations do not neutralize control characters in text
    controlled by remote endpoints
description: |-
    ### Impact

    Mutagen command line operations, as well as the log output from `mutagen daemon
    run`, are susceptible to control characters that could be provided by remote
    endpoints. This can cause terminal corruption, either intentional or
    unintentional, if these characters are present in error messages, file
    paths/names, and/or log output. This could be used as an attack vector if
    synchronizing with an untrusted remote endpoint, synchronizing files not under
    control of the user, or forwarding to/from an untrusted remote endpoint. On very
    old systems with terminals susceptible to issues such as
    [CVE-2003-0069](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0069), the issue could
    theoretically cause code execution.

    ### Patches

    The problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1. Earlier versions of
    Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched. Versions of Mutagen
    after v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged.

    One caveat is that the templating functionality of Mutagen's `list` and
    `monitor` commands has been only partially patched. In particular, the `json`
    template function already provided escaping and no patching was necessary.
    However, raw template output has been left unescaped because this raw output may
    be necessary for commands which embed Mutagen. To aid these commands, a new
    `shellSanitize` template function has been added which provides control
    character neutralization in strings.

    ### Workarounds

    Avoiding synchronization of untrusted files or interaction with untrusted remote
    endpoints should mitigate any risk.
