    ### Impact Users or API keys with permission to expire verification codes could
    have expired codes that belonged to another realm if they guessed the UUID.

    ### Patches v1.1.2+

    ### Workarounds There are no workarounds, and there are no indications this has
    been exploited in the wild. Verification codes can only be expired by providing
    their 64-bit UUID, and verification codes are already valid for a very short
    period of time (thus the UUID rotates frequently).
