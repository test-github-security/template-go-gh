summary: Exposure of client IP addresses in net/http
description: |-
    Client IP adresses may be unintentionally exposed via X-Forwarded-For headers.

    When httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP is called with a Request.Header map
    containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy sets the
    client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its
    documentation.

    In the more usual case where a Director function sets the X-Forwarded-For header
    value to nil, ReverseProxy leaves the header unmodified as expected.

    cwe: 'CWE-200: Information Exposure'
    description: |-
        Improper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go
        1.18.4 can be triggered by calling httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with a
        Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, which
        causes ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For
        header.
