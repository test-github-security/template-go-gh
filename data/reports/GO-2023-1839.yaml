summary: Code injection via go command with cgo in cmd/go
description: |-
    The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using cgo. This
    may result in unexpected behavior when running a go program which uses cgo.

    This may occur when running an untrusted module which contains directories with
    newline characters in their names. Modules which are retrieved using the go
    command, i.e. via "go get", are not affected (modules retrieved using
    GOPATH-mode, i.e. GO111MODULE=off, may be affected).
