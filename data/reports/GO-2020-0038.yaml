summary: Improper authentication in github.com/pion/dtls
description: |-
    Due to improper verification of packets, unencrypted packets containing
    application data are accepted after the initial handshake. This allows an
    attacker to inject arbitrary data which the client/server believes was
    encrypted, despite not knowing the session key.
