summary: The x/crisis package does not cause chain halt in github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
description: |-
    If an invariant check fails on a Cosmos SDK network, and a transaction is sent
    to the x/crisis package to halt the chain, the chain does not halt as originally
    intended.

    No patch will be released, as the package is planned to be deprecated
    and replaced.
