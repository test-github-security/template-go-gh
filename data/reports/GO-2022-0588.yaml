summary: Cross-site scripting in github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday
description: |-
    The bluemonday HTML sanitizer can leak the contents of a "style" element into
    HTML output, potentially causing XSS vulnerabilities.

    The default bluemonday sanitization policies are not vulnerable. Only
    user-defined policies allowing "select", "style", and "option" elements are
    affected.

    Permitting the "style" element in policies is hazardous, because bluemonday does
    not contain a CSS sanitizer. Newer versions of bluemonday suppress "style" and
    "script" elements even when allowed by a policy unless the policy explicitly
    requests unsafe processing.
