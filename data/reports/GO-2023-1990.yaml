summary: Excessive CPU consumption when decoding 0-height images in golang.org/x/image/tiff
description: |-
    A maliciously-crafted image can cause excessive CPU consumption in decoding.

    A tiled image with a height of 0 and a very large width can cause
    excessive CPU consumption, despite the image size (width * height)
    appearing to be zero.
