summary: Improper sanitization of LDFLAGS in go command with cgo in cmd/go
description: |-
    The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may
    occur when running "go get" on a malicious module, or when running any other
    command which builds untrusted code. This is can by triggered by linker flags,
    specified via a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive.

    The arguments for a number of flags which are non-optional are incorrectly
    considered optional, allowing disallowed flags to be smuggled through the
    LDFLAGS sanitization. This affects usage of both the gc and gccgo compilers.
