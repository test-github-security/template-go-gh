summary: Blst fails to perform group signature validation
description: |-
    When complemented with a check for infinity, blst skips performing a signature
    group-check. Formally speaking, infinity is the identity element of the elliptic
    curve group and as such it is a member of the group, so the group-check should
    be performed. The fix performs the check even in the presence of infinity.
