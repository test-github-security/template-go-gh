summary: Incorrect sanitization of forwarded query parameters in net/http/httputil
description: |-
    Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from the
    inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http. This
    could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter with
    an unparsable value.

    After fix, ReverseProxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query
    when the outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy. Director
    function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters.
    Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original
    query parameters unchanged.
