summary: Deadlock in github.com/cometbft/cometbft/consensus
description: |-
    An internal modification to the way PeerState is serialized to JSON introduced
    a deadlock when the new function MarshalJSON is called.

    This function can be called in two ways. The first is via logs, by setting
    the consensus logging module to "debug" level (which should not happen in
    production), and setting the log output format to JSON. The second is via
    RPC dump_consensus_state.
