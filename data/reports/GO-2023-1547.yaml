summary: Information disclosure in helm.sh/helm/v3
description: |-
    An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the `getHostByName` template
    function.

    `getHostByName` is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. The function
    is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get
    the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when
    used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render
    a chart.

    Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to
    lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject
    `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS
    server.
