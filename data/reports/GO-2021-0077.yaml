summary: Authentication bypass in go.etcd.io/etcd
description: |-
    A user can use a valid client certificate that contains a CommonName that
    matches a valid RBAC username to authenticate themselves as that user, despite
    lacking the required credentials. This may allow authentication bypass, but
    requires a certificate that is issued by a CA trusted by the server.
