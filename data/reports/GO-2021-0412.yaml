summary: Incorrect authorization in github.com/containerd/imgcrypt
description: |-
    The imgcrypt library provides API extensions for containerd to support encrypted
    container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by
    containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function
    `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized
    to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that
    another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to
    1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the
    architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only
    the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers
    available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore,
    the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating
    that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available.
    However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in
    the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had
    previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4.
    Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.
