summary: |-
    Denial of service in

description: |-
    The otelhttp package of opentelemetry-go-contrib is vulnerable to a
    denial-of-service attack.

    The otelhttp package uses the httpconv.ServerRequest function to annotate metric
    measurements for the http.server.request_content_length,
    http.server.response_content_length, and http.server.duration instruments. The
    ServerRequest function sets the http.target attribute value to be the whole
    request URI (including the query string). The metric instruments do not "forget"
    previous measurement attributes when "cumulative" temporality is used, meaning
    that the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with
    the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random, this will
    result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used in a
    denial-of-service attack.
