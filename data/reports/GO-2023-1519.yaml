summary: Command injection in github.com/rancher/wrangler
description: |-
    A command injection vulnerability exists in the Wrangler Git package. Specially
    crafted commands can be passed to Wrangler that will change their behavior and
    cause confusion when executed through Git, resulting in command injection in the
    underlying host.

    A workaround is to sanitize input passed to the Git package to remove potential
    unsafe and ambiguous characters. Otherwise, the best course of action is to
    update to a patched Wrangler version.
