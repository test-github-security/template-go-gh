summary: Repository credentials passed to alternate domain in helm.sh/helm/v3
description: |-
    The username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository can be
    passed to another domain referenced by that Helm repository.

    If the index.yaml for a Helm repository is hosted on one domain and references a
    chart archive on a different domain, Helm will provide the credentials for the
    index.yaml's domain when fetching those archives.
