summary: Weak encryption and denial of service in github.com/flynn/noise
description: |-
    The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic security
    after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of service attack.

    After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted with the Encrypt function,
    the nonce counter will wrap around, causing multiple messages to be encrypted
    with the same key and nonce.

    In a separate issue, the Decrypt function increments the nonce state even when
    it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker can provide an invalid input to
    the Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state to desynchronize between
    the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages.
