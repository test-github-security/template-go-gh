summary: Denial of service via repository index file in helm.sh/helm/v3
description: |-
    Applications that use the repo package in the Helm SDK to parse an index file
    can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be
    recovered from.

    The repo package contains a handler that processes the index file of a
    repository. For example, the Helm client adds references to chart repositories
    where charts are managed. The repo package parses the index file of the
    repository and loads it into memory. Some index files can cause array data
    structures to be created causing a memory violation.

    The Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory violation
    panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future
    uses of the Helm client.
