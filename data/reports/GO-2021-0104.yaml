summary: Authorization bypass in github.com/pion/webrtc/v3
description: |-
    Due to improper error handling, DTLS connections were not killed when
    certificate verification failed, causing users who did not check the connection
    state to continue to use the connection. This could allow allow an attacker
    which holds the ICE password, but not a valid certificate, to bypass this
    restriction.
