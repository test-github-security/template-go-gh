summary: |-
    Uncontrolled resource consumption during consensus in
    github.com/tendermint/tendermint
description: |-
    Mishandling of timestamps during consensus process can cause a denial of
    service.

    While reaching consensus, different tendermint nodes can observe a different
    timestamp for a consensus evidence. This mismatch can cause the evidence to be
    invalid, upon which the node producing the evidence will be asked to generate a
    new evidence. This new evidence will be the same, which means it will again be
    rejected by other nodes involved in the consensus. This loop will continue until
    the peer nodes decide to disconnect from the node producing the evidence.
