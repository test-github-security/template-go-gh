summary: Panic via malicious inputs in github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go
description: |-
    Malicious inputs can cause a panic.

    A maliciously crafted input can cause a stack overflow and panic. Any user with
    access to the GraphQL can send such a query.

    This issue only occurs when using the graphql.MaxDepth schema option (which is
    highly recommended in most cases).
