summary: Excessive memory allocation in net/http and net/textproto
description: |-
    HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when
    parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.

    Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to
    parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required
    to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior to cause an
    HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small request,
    potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.

    With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to
    hold parsed headers.
