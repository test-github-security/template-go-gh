summary: Uncontrolled resource consumption in github.com/tendermint/tendermint
description: |-
    Due to support of Gzip compression in request bodies, as well as a lack of
    limiting response body sizes, a malicious server can cause a client to consume a
    significant amount of system resources, which may be used as a denial of service
    vector.
