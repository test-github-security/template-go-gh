summary: Improper handling of token revocation in github.com/ory/fosite
description: |-
    Due to improper error handling, an error with the underlying token storage may
    cause a user to believe a token has been successfully revoked when it is in fact
    still valid. An attackers ability to exploit this relies on an ability to
    trigger errors in the underlying storage.
