summary: Insecure wildcard CORS policy in github.com/rs/cors
description: |-
    The CORS handler actively converts a wildcard CORS policy into reflecting an
    arbitrary Origin header value, which is incompatible with the CORS security
    design, and could lead to CORS misconfiguration security problems.
