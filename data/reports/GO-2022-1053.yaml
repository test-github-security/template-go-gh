summary: Incorrect signatures in github.com/supranational/blst
description: |-
    Potential creation of an invalid signature from correct inputs.

    Some inputs to the blst_fp_eucl_inverse function can produce incorrect outputs.
    This could theoretically permit the creation of an invalid signature from
    correct inputs.
