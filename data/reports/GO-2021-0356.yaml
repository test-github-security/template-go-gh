summary: Denial of service via crafted Signer in golang.org/x/crypto/ssh
description: |-
    Attackers can cause a crash in SSH servers when the server has been configured
    by passing a Signer to ServerConfig.AddHostKey such that
    1) the Signer passed to AddHostKey does not implement AlgorithmSigner, and
    2) the Signer passed to AddHostKey returns a key of type “ssh-rsa” from its
    PublicKey method.

    Servers that only use Signer implementations provided by the ssh package are
    unaffected.
