summary: Improper input validation in github.com/google/go-attestation
description: |-
    A local attacker can defeat remotely-attested measured boot.

    Improper input validation in AKPublic.Verify can cause it to succeed when
    provided with a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs. Subsequent use of
    the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed
    by quote verification, meaning a local attacker can couple this vulnerability
    with a maliciously-formed TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG
    log, defeating remotely-attested measured-boot.
