summary: Denial of service in github.com/facebook/fbthrift
description: |-
    Thirft Servers preallocate memory for the declared size of messages before
    checking the actual size of the message. This allows a malicious user to send
    messages that declare that they are significantly larger than they actually are,
    allowing them to force the server to allocate significant amounts of memory.
    This can be used as a denial of service vector.
