    description: |-
        Uncontrolled recursion in Unmarshal in encoding/xml before Go 1.17.12 and Go
        1.18.4 allows an attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via
        unmarshalling an XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field that
        uses the 'any' field tag.
