summary: |-
    Privilege escalation via supplementary groups in
    github.com/containerd/containerd
description: |-
    Supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker
    has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group
    access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary
    group restrictions in some cases and potentially escalate privileges in the
    container. Uses of the containerd client library may also have improperly setup
    supplementary groups.
