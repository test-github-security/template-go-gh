summary: Session tickets lack random ticket_age_add in crypto/tls
description: |-
    An attacker can correlate a resumed TLS session with a previous connection.

    Session tickets generated by crypto/tls do not contain a randomly generated
    ticket_age_add, which allows an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to
    correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session
    resumption.

    cwe: 'CWE-200: Information Exposure'
    description: |-
        Non-random values for ticket_age_add in session tickets in crypto/tls before Go
        1.17.11 and Go 1.18.3 allow an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to
        correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session
        resumption.
