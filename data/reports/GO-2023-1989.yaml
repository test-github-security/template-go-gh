summary: Excessive resource consumption in golang.org/x/image/tiff
description: |-
    The TIFF decoder does not place a limit on the size of
    compressed tile data. A maliciously-crafted image can
    exploit this to cause a small image (both in terms of
    pixel width/height, and encoded size) to make the decoder
    decode large amounts of compressed data, consuming
    excessive memory and CPU.
