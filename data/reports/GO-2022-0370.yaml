summary: |-
    Man-in-the-middle attack due to improper validation of certificate in
    mellium.im/xmpp
description: |-
    Websocket client connections are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks via DNS
    spoofing.

    When looking up a WSS endpoint using a DNS TXT record, the server TLS
    certificate is incorrectly validated using the name of the server returned by
    the TXT record request, not the name of the the server being connected to. This
    permits any attacker that can spoof a DNS record to redirect the user to a
    server of their choosing.

    Providing a *tls.Config with a ServerName field set to the correct destination
    hostname will avoid this issue.
