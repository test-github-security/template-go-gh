summary: Repository access credential leak in github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2
description: |-
    Argo CD has an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials
    in error messages.

    These error messages are visible to the user, and they are logged. The error
    message is visible when a user attempts to create or update an Application via
    the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or CLI).

    The user must have `applications, create` or `applications, update` RBAC access
    to reach the code which may produce the error. The user is not guaranteed to be
    able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with
    requests to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository.

    If the user has `repositories, update` access, they may edit an existing
    repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message.
