summary: Improper sanitization of LDFLAGS in go command with cgo in cmd/go
description: |-
    The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may
    occur when running "go get" on a malicious module, or when running any other
    command which builds untrusted code. This is can by triggered by linker flags,
    specified via a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive.

    Flags containing embedded spaces are mishandled, allowing disallowed flags to be
    smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization by including them in the argument of
    another flag. This only affects usage of the gccgo compiler.
