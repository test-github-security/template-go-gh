summary: Improper validation of UUIDs in github.com/codenotary/immudb
description: |-
    A malicious server can trick a client into treating it as a different server by
    changing the reported UUID.

    immudb client SDKs use the server's UUID to distinguish between different server
    instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep
    the state for multiple servers. The SDK does not validate this UUID and accepts
    any value reported by the server. A malicious server can therefore change the
    reported UUID and trick the client into treating it as a different server.
