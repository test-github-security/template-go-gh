summary: |-
    Improper handling of filenames in Content-Disposition HTTP header in
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin
description: |-
    The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly
    sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition
    header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the
    Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt"
    will be sent as a file named "setup.bat".

    If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted
    source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name
    different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the
    Content-Disposition header.
